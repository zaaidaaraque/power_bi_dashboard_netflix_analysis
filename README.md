# Movies Analysis Dashboard
 
Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing almost 10,000 movies (TMDB-format dataset), exploring production trends over time, 
distribution by genre and language, and popularity/rating rankings.

## Project goal
 
Build a general-overview dashboard of the film industry that answers:
- How has movie production evolved over time?
- Which genres and languages dominate the catalog?
- Is there a relationship between the number of movies in a genre and its average popularity?
- Which movies are the most popular and highest rated?

## Dataset
 
Source: [Netflix Movies and TV Shows Data Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nalisha/netflix-movies-and-tv-shows-data-analysis) 
(Kaggle), a TMDB-format dataset with ~9,800 records: title, release date, popularity, vote count, average rating, original language, genre(s), and poster.

## Data model
 
Star schema with 3 main tables + a measures table:
 
| Table | Role | Rows | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mymoviedb (1)` | Fact | 9,827 | One row per movie, with unique `ID` (Title + Release Date) |
| `mymoviedb (2)` | Bridge | 25,774 | One row per movie–genre combination (M:N relationship via `Genre`) |
| `Calendar` | Time dimension | 44,639 | Continuous date table, marked as the official date table |
| `Measures table` | Measures | — | Container table for all DAX measures |
 
**Key relationship:** `mymoviedb (2)[ID]` → `mymoviedb (1)[ID]`, many-to-one cardinality, bidirectional cross-filter

### Key transformations (Power Query)
 
- Removed rows with source errors/nulls.
- Composite `ID` column (`Date — Title`) to avoid collisions between movies with duplicate titles.
- Extracted `Year` and `Month Name` from `Release_Date`.
- Split `Genre` into a long-format bridge table (one row per genre), with text trimmed to remove whitespace-based duplicates.
- Translated ISO language codes (`en`, `ja`, `es`...) into full names (`English`, `Japanese`, `Spanish`...) for more readable visuals.
